This is a module for [AzerothCore](https://www.azerothcore.org).

It lets any summoned non-combat (vanity) pet act as an immersive auto-loot assistant for the player. It can also be limited to a single pet, such as **Bananas** (ID 23234).

## Features
- **Visual Movement**: The pet physically runs to the location of the killed creature before looting.
- **Looting Animation**: Upon reaching the corpse, the pet plays a "Loot" animation (emote) for immersion.
- **Auto-Loot**: Items and gold are automatically handled using AzerothCore native loot systems, including inventory validation, quest requirements, unique item checks, group loot rules, and gold sharing.
- **Distance Check**: The pet only loots if the player is within a configurable distance from the corpse (default: 50 yards).
- **Stability**: Uses `Player::StoreLootItem` to ensure compatibility with unique items, bag space, and quest requirements.
- **Group Loot Support**: Fully respects AzerothCore group loot rules (Free For All, Group Loot, Need Before Greed, Master Loot, Round-Robin). The pet automatically triggers the appropriate loot system exactly once, shares gold correctly between nearby group members, and leaves active loot rolls and master-loot distributions fully managed by the core.
- **Safe Group Roll Handling**: Prevents duplicate Need/Greed or Master Loot rolls when players manually open the corpse after the pet has already initialized the loot.
- **Configurable**: You can enable/disable the module, change the Pet ID, and adjust the looting radius via the config file.

## Requirements
- AzerothCore (latest version)
- A player with a non-combat pet summoned (or the pet set in `PetLoot.PetId`).
